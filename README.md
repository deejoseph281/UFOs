# UFOs_Javascript

## Objective
The purpose of this technical analysis is to fulter UFO sightings based on multuple criteria in addition to filtering by the date. The added filters include webpage, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

The results of the code allows the user to enter the values for the filter. The user is able to filter by date, 
We are now able to filter the data, without clicking anywhere but just entering the values we want to filter by in the cases.

## Summary

One drawback of the result of the code is that the html page is hard to read. The results are long, and it is hard to understand the trends in the results. 

### Recommendations:

A recommendation for the drawback would be to add a summary table to help understand the results of the filter which includes the number of sightings, the number of cities, and the average duration of the sightings. 

Our second recommendation would be to allow dynamic filters to include or remove specific filters without it having to be sequential.
